# Fingerprint-Vehicle-Starter---Arduino

A system to ensure that only authorized drivers can use your vehicle. The prototype was created using Arduino.

The most unique and secure form of identification is a person’s fingerprint, and this is used for starting the engine. A user is first registered as an authorised person. A maximum of 10 users can be registered. The engine starts when an authorised user scans the fingerprint and doesn’t allow unauthorised users to start. After the validation of fingerprint, the relay module (like a switch), is turned on. Once this relay module is activated, the ignition system, which consists of a motor, is turned on.
